# Restavratsia
This little project is written on ReactJS(client) and .Net(server).
This is single-page application(SPA), that means - all pages you see are actually one page,
that renders and takes away parts inside this single page. Parts, in my case - are React 
components. Why did I choose the React? Because all of components are reusable and easy to
understand. And variety of modules helps you develop app faster and less complicated.
